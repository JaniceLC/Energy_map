3N - 6 internal degrees of freedom 

**A molecule has an x, y, and z coordinate for all N atoms. This gives 3N coordinates. If we translate the molecule, none of the internal degrees of freedom change (all atoms still have the same interatomic distance to all other atoms as they did before translation). The same is true of rotation. All molecules have 3 translations. Non-linear molecules have 3 rotations. This leaves 3N-6 internal degrees of freedom which will change the interatomic distances between atoms.**

3N -5 if linear
